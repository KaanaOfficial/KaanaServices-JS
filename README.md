# üöÄ Kaana Services JS Library

The Kaana Services JS Library is a JavaScript library that can be used by all Kaana apps to interact with Kaana Auth. This library uses the Kaana Auth API endpoint to retrieve user data and utilizes Pinia as a local store for data management.

## Installation

To install the Kaana Services JS Library, run the following command in your project directory using:

```bash
npm install kaana-services-js
```

## Usage

### Importing the Library

To use the Kaana Services JS Library in your application, import it as follows:

```js
import { useAuthStore } from "kaana-services-js";
```

## Retrieving User Data

To retrieve user data, call the appropriate function on the `useAuthStore` object. For example, to retrieve the user profile information, call the `fetchUserProfile` action with the user ID and access token:

```js
const authStore = useAuthStore();
await authStore.fetchUserProfile("123", "myToken");
const userProfile = authStore.userProfile;
```

Similarly, you can call the `fetchPersonalPreferences`, `fetchAccountDetails`, `fetchActivityHistory`, and `fetchRecommendations` actions to retrieve personal preferences, account details, activity history, and recommendations, respectively.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the API call, an error will be thrown. You can catch the error as follows:

```js
try {
  await authStore.fetchUserProfile("123", "myToken");
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

## Token-Based Security

To ensure token-based security, you must pass the user's access token to the appropriate function. The access token will be included in the HTTP request headers.
